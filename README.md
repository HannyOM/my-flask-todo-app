# Flask Todo Application

A basic Todo application made with flask to help track your tasks.

## Requirements:

NOTE: For any installation you do not know yet, please check YouTube for a video tutorial on how to install it.

You should have installed:

- Python 3.13.2 (or the latest python)
- Visual Studio Code (or any other IDE e.g Pycharm, Atom)

## Process:

1. Create a folder to contain the entire project. Here, I used the name "my-flask-todo-app".

2. Access the folder "my-flask-todo-app" in the terminal and create a virtual environment by running the syntax below:

   `python -m venv virtual_env`

## Suggestions for Improvement:

1. Add date and time tracking.
2. Add notifications for reminders.
3. Add caller agent for better reminders.
